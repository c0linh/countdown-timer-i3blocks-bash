Countdown Timer for Bash and i3blocks
=====================================
This project provides a set of tools to manage countdown timers within a bash environment and integrates seamlessly with the i3 window manager through i3blocks. It consists of three main components:

- timer.sh: A countdown timer script written in pure bash.
- timerd.sh: A daemon script that complements timer.sh by adding daemon capabilities.
- timer-i3block.sh: Allows the timer to be controlled and displayed within [i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks?tab=readme-ov-file#example).
- timer-functions.sh: Contains fuctions and declares global parameters for timer.sh

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
cp timer_block ~/.config/i3/i3blocks/config
```
Ensure you have bash and i3blocks installed on your system. For the icons to display correctly in the i3blocks integration, a Nerd Fonts-compatible font must be installed and used within your terminal or i3bar.

Usage
-----
### timer.sh
A simple, bash-based countdown timer that manages its state through files without requiring daemon capabilities.

- aquire and realease lockfile
- time related function using "date" (parse, convert, format)

Must be sourceable by timer.sh

### timerd.sh

A daemon that interfaces with timer.sh, allowing commands to be read from stdin and results outputted to stdout, enhancing usability in continuous operation contexts.

#### Features:

- Customizable tick rate for update frequency.

#### Usage:

```
timerd.sh [tick]
```
For detailed command descriptions and parameters, see Daemon Script Help.

### timer-i3block.sh

Integrates the timer with i3blocks, offering an interactive display and control mechanism directly within the i3bar.

#### Features:
- Displays the timer state with Nerd Fonts icons.
